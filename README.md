# Product Catalog Manager

This is a Spring Boot-based microservice for managing product catalogs.

## 🚀 How to Run

To start the application using **Docker Compose**, run:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build and start the necessary containers.

## ⏹️ How to Stop

To stop and remove containers, volumes, and networks, run:

```sh
docker-compose down -v
```

This ensures a clean shutdown and removes any persisted data.
